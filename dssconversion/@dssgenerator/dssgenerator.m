% OpenDSS generator object
% This class keeps track of default values for each of the parameters of
% the opendss object, as well as user-assigned parameters, and then can
% pass them on to other objects for use in converting opendss files to
% other formats (see get() ) or can print itself as a char string (see
% char() ) for converting to OpenDSS from other formats.
%
% Generally, for converting to opendss you will want to create one or more
% empty objects and then fill in some values, then export to a text file
% using the char() function.
%
% There are three valid ways to create these objects (specified generically
% so replace 'dssobject' with the class name):
%	dssobject()
%	dssobject(struct)
%	dssobject('prop1',value1,'prop2',value2,...)
%
% The first creates an empty object ready to be filled in
% The second and third populate as many values as possible based on the
% data passed in as arguments or as a struct.  Unknown properties are
% ignored.  Order of properties is not important in the third format.
% Unfortunately, we currently do not support struct arrays or the cell
% array style input that struct() accepts for creating struct arrays.

% The class structure is as follows:
% obj.defaults contains the default values of all the parameters
% obj.data contains user-set values of all parameters
% obj.fieldnames contains the fieldnames of the two structs to save you
% making lots of extra calls.
%
% The concept of this separation of data is that it allows us to present a
% "complete, as opendss would use it" version of the model for converting
% to other formats while only setting the fields we need to explicitly when
% converting TO OpenDSS.
% 
% The question has come up about what to do if there are values we'd like
% to keep in a general conversion utility that don't neatly fit into
% openDSS.  First, make sure they actually don't (openDSS has a lot of
% stuff, and we keep finding ways that it actually does support the
% property we thought it didn't).  The idea I had was to add a third
% sub-struct to hold custom data in some format.  Then modify the 'get' and
% 'set' accessors to use data from it when appropriate.  That way, we can
% continue to maintain separation of data.
%
% When duplicating this class, it should only be necessary to change a few
% methods.  You'll want to change the object defaults below in this file,
% and you'll want to change how the object deals with handling new data in
% the set() function, but that should be about it.  (of course, as you add
% new things, you may also find bugs in various other files that need
% fixing).

% that now
